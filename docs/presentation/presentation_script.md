## **SLIDE 4: Method - Data Details (30 seconds)**

**[SPEAKING]**
"We used the MIMIC-III clinical database, which contains real patient data from intensive care units. Our dataset includes 46,520 patients with complete demographics, nearly 59,000 hospital admissions, over 650,000 ICD-9 diagnoses, 240,000 medical procedures, and more than 4 million medication prescriptions. From this rich clinical data, we generated 200 authentic clinical notes and summaries, split into training, validation, and test sets. This gives us a realistic foundation for evaluating our AI system."

**[KEY POINTS TO EMPHASIZE]**
- Real MIMIC-III patient data

## **SLIDE 5: Method - Methodology Details (30 seconds)**

**[SPEAKING]**
"Our system architecture follows a safety-first design. We take a clinical note, apply carefully engineered prompts with medical examples, and use GPT-4o to generate summaries. Each generated summary then goes through our comprehensive hallucination detection system, which checks for factual consistency, medical term accuracy, semantic similarity, and logical consistency. This multi-layered approach ensures we catch potential medical errors before they could impact patient care."

**[KEY POINTS TO EMPHASIZE]**
- Safety-first design
- Prompt engineering with medical examples
- GPT-4o integration
