## Slide 1: Title Slide
**High-Risk AI in Healthcare: Few-Shot Clinical Note Summarization with Hallucination Detection**

- **Project Type**: High-Risk Research
- **Topic**: Clinical NLP with Safety Evaluation
- **Approach**: Few-Shot Learning with GPT-4o
- **Key Innovation**: Hallucination Detection System

---

## Slide 2: Introduction & Motivation

### What is this project about?
- **Problem**: Clinical notes are lengthy and time-consuming to summarize manually
- **Goal**: Automatically generate concise, accurate summaries of medical notes
- **Challenge**: Ensure summaries don't contain incorrect medical information

### Why is it important?
- **Healthcare Efficiency**: Reduce documentation burden on clinicians
- **Patient Safety**: Accurate summaries prevent medical errors
- **Clinical Decision Support**: Quick access to key patient information

---

## Slide 3: Problem Statement

### The Challenge
- Clinical notes contain complex medical information
- Manual summarization is time-consuming and error-prone
- AI-generated summaries could contain hallucinations
- Patient safety is paramount in healthcare

### Research Question
**Can few-shot learning with GPT-4o generate accurate clinical summaries while maintaining safety?**

---

## Slide 4: High-Risk Innovation

### Why is this "High-Risk"?
1. **Prompt Engineering Dependency**: Success depends entirely on prompt quality
2. **Hallucination Risk**: LLMs can generate plausible but incorrect medical info
3. **Generalization Uncertainty**: May not work for unseen medical conditions
4. **Performance Variability**: Results could vary significantly with different prompts

### Our Novel Approach
- Few-shot learning with GPT-4o
- Comprehensive hallucination detection
- Safety-first evaluation methodology

---

## Slide 5: Methodology

### Dataset
- **200 synthetic clinical notes** covering 8 medical conditions
- Hypertension, diabetes, pneumonia, heart failure, sepsis, stroke, kidney disease, cancer
- Train/Val/Test split: 70%/15%/15%

### Baseline Method
- Rule-based extraction using regular expressions
- Pattern matching for demographics, vital signs, diagnosis, treatment

### Few-Shot Method
- GPT-4o with carefully crafted prompts
- Few-shot examples for different medical conditions
- Guidelines for accuracy and avoiding speculation

---

## Slide 6: Hallucination Detection System

### Safety Evaluation Components
1. **Factual Consistency**: Check if facts match source notes
2. **Medical Term Verification**: Validate medical terminology
3. **Semantic Similarity**: Measure content overlap
4. **Logical Consistency**: Detect contradictions

### Key Innovation
- Real-time safety assessment
- Multi-dimensional evaluation
- Risk scoring for each summary
