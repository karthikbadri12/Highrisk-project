### 2. Setup Your Environment

```bash
# Clone or download this template
cd "AI HL"

# Create virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Create necessary directories
python -c "from src.utils.config import config; config.create_directories()"
```

### 3. Customize Your Project

#### Update Project Information
1. Edit `docs/project_plan.md` with your specific details
2. Update `README.md` with your project title and description
3. Modify `src/utils/config.py` for your specific needs

#### Choose Your Dataset
- **Public Healthcare Datasets:**
  - [MIMIC-IV](https://mimic.mit.edu/) - Clinical data (requires approval)
  - [PhysioNet](https://physionet.org/) - Various medical datasets
  - [PadChest](https://padchest.um.es/) - Chest X-ray images
  - [IU-Xray](https://openi.nlm.nih.gov/) - X-ray images with reports

#### Set Up Data Pipeline
1. Create your data loading script in `src/data/`
2. Use the exploration template: `notebooks/01_data_exploration_template.py`
3. Implement preprocessing in `src/data/`

### 4. Implement Your Baseline

```python
# Example: Run baseline experiment
from src.models.baseline_model import run_baseline_experiment
import pandas as pd

# Load your data
df = pd.read_csv('your_data.csv')

# Run baseline
results = run_baseline_experiment(df, target_col='your_target', task_type='classification')
print("Baseline results:", results)
```

### 5. Implement Your High-Risk Innovation

Create your novel approach in `src/models/`:

```python
# Example: Custom model template
class HighRiskModel:
    def __init__(self):
        # Initialize your novel approach
        pass
    
    def train(self, data):
        # Implement your high-risk method
        pass
    
    def evaluate(self, data):
        # Evaluate your approach
        pass
```

### 6. Track Your Progress

#### Weekly Milestones
- **Week 1**: Literature review, dataset acquisition, baseline setup
- **Week 2**: Baseline implementation and evaluation
- **Week 3**: High-risk method implementation
- **Week 4**: Comprehensive experiments and analysis
- **Week 5**: Writing and visualization
- **Week 6**: Final report and presentation

#### Document Everything
- Use the logging utilities: `from src.utils import logger`
- Save all results to `results/` directory
- Track failures and learnings in your project plan

### 7. Write Your Report

#### Use the ACM Template
1. Copy `docs/report/acm_template.tex` to your report file
2. Fill in each section with your specific content
3. Include figures and tables from your experiments
4. Be honest about limitations and failures

#### Key Sections to Focus On
- **Introduction**: Clearly state your high-risk approach
- **Methodology**: Detail your novel method
- **Results**: Present both successes and failures
- **Discussion**: Reflect on what you learned

### 8. Create Your Presentation

#### Use the Template
1. Follow `docs/presentation/presentation_template.md`
2. Create slides using your preferred tool (PowerPoint, Google Slides, etc.)
3. Practice timing (5 minutes total)
4. Record your presentation

#### Presentation Tips
- Emphasize the "high-risk" nature
- Be honest about failures
- Show what you learned
- Connect to healthcare impact

### 9. Submit Your Deliverables

#### Required Files
- [ ] ACM-style research report (~5 pages)
- [ ] Presentation slides
- [ ] Code repository (this GitHub repo)
- [ ] Presentation video (< 5 min)

#### File Organization
```
