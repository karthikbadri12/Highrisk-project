\begin{abstract}
This paper presents a high-risk approach to clinical note summarization using few-shot learning with GPT-4o. We propose a novel methodology that combines prompt engineering with hallucination detection to generate concise, accurate summaries of clinical notes. Our experimental results on a synthetic dataset of 200 clinical notes demonstrate the potential and challenges of this approach. Despite the high-risk nature of relying on prompt engineering and the possibility of generating incorrect medical information, we provide valuable insights into the feasibility of few-shot learning in healthcare applications and the importance of safety mechanisms in clinical AI systems.

\section{Introduction}

Healthcare represents one of the most critical domains where artificial intelligence can have transformative impact. Clinical note summarization, in particular, has the potential to significantly improve healthcare efficiency by automatically generating concise summaries of lengthy medical records. However, this task presents unique challenges due to the critical nature of medical information and the potential for AI systems to generate incorrect or misleading content.

\subsection{Motivation}

Clinical notes are typically lengthy documents containing detailed patient information, including demographics, vital signs, laboratory results, assessments, and treatment plans. Manual summarization of these notes is time-consuming and subject to human error. Automated summarization could help healthcare providers quickly access key information, reduce documentation burden, and improve patient care quality. However, the stakes are extremely high in healthcare applications, where incorrect information could lead to serious patient harm.

\subsection{Problem Statement}

The challenge of clinical note summarization involves:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Extracting key clinical information from lengthy medical notes
    \item Generating concise, accurate summaries that preserve critical medical facts
    \item Ensuring the generated summaries do not contain hallucinations or incorrect information
    \item Maintaining consistency with medical terminology and clinical standards
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{High-Risk Innovation}

Our approach is considered high-risk because it relies heavily on few-shot learning with large language models (LLMs), specifically GPT-4o. This methodology is risky for several reasons:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Prompt Engineering Dependency}: The success of our approach depends entirely on the quality of prompt engineering, which may not work consistently across different medical conditions or note formats.
    \item \textbf{Hallucination Risk}: LLMs can generate plausible but incorrect medical information, which could be dangerous in clinical settings.
    \item \textbf{Generalization Uncertainty}: The model may not generalize well to unseen medical conditions or note structures.
    \item \textbf{Performance Variability}: Results could vary significantly with different prompt formats or model versions.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Contributions}

This work makes the following contributions:
\begin{itemize}
    \item A novel few-shot learning approach for clinical note summarization using GPT-4o
    \item A comprehensive hallucination detection system to evaluate summary safety
    \item An empirical evaluation of the risks and benefits of LLM-based clinical summarization
    \item Insights into the challenges of implementing AI systems in healthcare settings
\end{itemize}

\section{Related Work}

\subsection{Traditional Approaches}

Traditional clinical note summarization has relied on rule-based systems and extractive summarization techniques. These approaches typically use predefined templates and medical ontologies to identify and extract key information. While these methods are interpretable and reliable, they lack the flexibility to handle diverse note formats and medical conditions.

\subsection{Recent Advances}

Recent work has explored the use of neural networks for clinical text processing, including BERT-based models fine-tuned on medical corpora. However, these approaches require large amounts of labeled training data, which is often unavailable in healthcare settings due to privacy concerns and the specialized nature of medical text.

\subsection{Research Gap}

The existing literature lacks comprehensive evaluation of few-shot learning approaches for clinical summarization, particularly regarding safety and hallucination detection. Our work addresses this gap by implementing a complete pipeline that includes both summarization and safety evaluation.

\section{Methodology}

\subsection{Problem Formulation}

Given a clinical note $N$ containing patient information, vital signs, laboratory results, assessment, and treatment plan, our goal is to generate a concise summary $S$ that captures the essential clinical information while maintaining accuracy and avoiding hallucinations.

\subsection{Dataset}

We created a synthetic dataset of 200 clinical notes covering eight common medical conditions: hypertension, diabetes, pneumonia, heart failure, sepsis, stroke, kidney disease, and cancer. Each note includes patient demographics, vital signs, laboratory results, assessment, and treatment plan. The dataset was split into training (70\%), validation (15\%), and test (15\%) sets.

\subsection{Baseline Method}

We implemented a rule-based baseline that extracts key information using regular expressions and predefined patterns. This baseline identifies patient demographics, vital signs, diagnosis, and treatment plans using pattern matching techniques.

\subsection{Proposed Method}

Our few-shot approach uses GPT-4o with carefully crafted prompts that include:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Clear instructions for medical summarization
    \item Few-shot examples for different medical conditions
    \item Guidelines for maintaining accuracy and avoiding speculation
    \item Constraints on summary length and format
\end{itemize}

The prompt engineering strategy includes condition-specific examples to improve performance on different medical conditions.

\subsection{Hallucination Detection}

We implemented a comprehensive hallucination detection system that evaluates summaries based on:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Factual consistency with source notes
    \item Medical term verification
    \item Semantic similarity analysis
    \item Logical consistency checks
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Evaluation Metrics}

We evaluate our approach using:
\begin{itemize}
    \item ROUGE scores (ROUGE-1, ROUGE-2, ROUGE-L) for summary quality
    \item Hallucination detection scores for safety assessment
    \item Medical term accuracy for clinical relevance
    \item Summary length and readability metrics
\end{itemize}

\section{Experimental Setup}

\subsection{Implementation Details}

The experiment was implemented in Python using the OpenAI API for GPT-4o access. The hallucination detection system uses spaCy for natural language processing and scikit-learn for similarity calculations. All experiments were conducted on a standard desktop computer with no specialized hardware requirements.

\subsection{Hyperparameters}

Key hyperparameters for the few-shot approach include:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Temperature: 0.3 (for consistent outputs)
    \item Max tokens: 150 (for concise summaries)
    \item Top-p: 0.9 (for controlled randomness)
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Computational Resources}

The experiment required minimal computational resources, with most processing time spent on API calls to GPT-4o. The hallucination detection system runs locally and processes summaries in real-time.

\section{Results}

\subsection{Quantitative Results}

Our experiments yielded the following results:

\begin{table}[h]

ROUGE-2 & 0.23 & 0.45 \\
ROUGE-L & 0.38 & 0.68 \\
Hallucination Score & 0.85 & 0.72 \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

The few-shot approach showed significant improvements in ROUGE scores compared to the baseline, indicating better summary quality. However, the hallucination detection revealed potential safety concerns.

\subsection{Qualitative Analysis}
