# High-Risk AI in Healthcare: Few-Shot Clinical Note Summarization

## Project Overview
This repository contains a **completed high-risk AI project** in healthcare that explores few-shot learning for clinical note summarization with comprehensive hallucination detection. The project demonstrates both the potential and challenges of using large language models in healthcare applications.

## ðŸŽ¯ Project Status: COMPLETED 

This project has been successfully implemented and tested, providing valuable insights into:
- Few-shot learning for clinical NLP
- Hallucination detection in healthcare AI
- Safety evaluation methodologies
- The trade-offs between quality and safety in clinical AI

## Getting Started

## Quick Start

### Run the Complete Experiment
```bash
# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run the complete experiment
python run_experiment.py
```

### View Results
- **Final Report**: `results/final_experiment_report.json`
- **ACM Research Paper**: `docs/report/final_report.tex`
- **Presentation Slides**: `docs/presentation/final_presentation.md`

##  Key Results

| Metric | Baseline | Few-Shot | Improvement |
|--------|----------|----------|-------------|
| ROUGE-1 | 0.45 | 0.75 | +67% |
| ROUGE-2 | 0.23 | 0.45 | +96% |
| ROUGE-L | 0.38 | 0.68 | +79% |
| Hallucination Score | 0.85 | 0.52 | -39% |

**Key Finding**: While few-shot learning significantly improved summary quality, it also introduced safety concerns that require careful evaluation.

### 2. Setup Environment
```bash
# Create virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Project Timeline (6 weeks)
- **Week 1**: Form team, select topic, gather papers & dataset(s)
- **Week 2**: Baseline model/pipeline running end-to-end on small subset
- **Week 3**: Implement core "high-risk" idea
- **Week 4**: Experiments + ablations; start drafting Methodology & Related Work
- **Week 5**: Analyze results, draft Introduction/Conclusion, design figures
- **Week 6**: Polish paper, record 5-min presentation, push clean code

## Deliverables Completed

- [x] **ACM-style research report** (~5 pages) - `docs/report/final_report.tex`
- [x] **Presentation slides** - `docs/presentation/final_presentation.md`
- [x] **Code repository** - Complete implementation with documentation
- [x] **Experimental results** - Comprehensive evaluation with safety metrics
- [x] **Hallucination detection system** - Novel safety evaluation methodology

## High-Risk Project Guidelines
1. **Embrace Failure**: Document what doesn't work and why
2. **Measure Beyond Accuracy**: Consider privacy, fairness, clinical utility
3. **Reproducibility**: Release code and models
4. **Ethical Considerations**: Address bias, safety, and patient privacy
5. **Innovation**: Try something genuinely new to you
